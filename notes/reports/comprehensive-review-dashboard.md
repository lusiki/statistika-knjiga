# Comprehensive-review implementation dashboard

This is a view of the canonical implementation register and forward-handoff
ledger, not a second task list. If this page disagrees with either YAML file,
stop and repair the control state before editing book content.

## Current state

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Gate A0 | Accepted: D01-D16 and O01-O03 |
| Gate A1a | Accepted: D01 Chapter 10 correction specification; reviewer Luka Sikic; 2026-08-03 |
| Branch | `revision/comprehensive-review` |
| Baseline | `c163bda524b7081ec6a41d5ab75370f1700b1748` |
| Control implementation | `b3463c7b6f7dc7e03a76f74f3a297e2e158e4c6e` |
| Active write packet | None |
| Last completed packet | `P1A-C10` |
| Next permitted packet | `P1A-C11` |
| Review parents | 36 ratified; 0 accepted |
| Atomic child inventory | Complete: 371 stable children; 7 accepted, 5 deferred with reason, 359 ratified; zero unmapped |
| Exact packet catalogue | 188 packets: 8 accepted and 180 ratified, with stable IDs, typed contracts, unique sequence, and just-in-time dependencies |
| Review source coverage | 18 exact section manifests; their fingerprint union equals all 371 children; zero uncovered actionable findings |
| Chapter stages | 19 `draft` |
| Open outside asks | 81 canonical asks remain `drafted_unsent`; `OA-G-A1A-C10-SPEC` is `done`; 0 external messages sent |
| Invalidated or reopened work | None |
| Failed gates | None; `P1A-C10` passed all packet gates and `P1A-C11` is next |

No chapter prose was changed by `P0-OUTSIDE`.

## P0-REGISTER closeout

- `H-G-A0-001` and `H-P0-CONTROL-001` were consumed with evidence.
- The register contains 371 stable children under R01-R36, 188 exact packets,
  29 typed packet contracts, and 18 bidirectional source manifests.
- The validator reconciles every source fingerprint and requires structured
  receipts for every terminal packet requirement, output, and exit test.
- The `generic_packet_evidence` negative fixture proves that an arbitrary
  `done` token cannot close a packet.
- Eight forward handoffs, `H-P0-REGISTER-001` through `008`, preserve findings
  that constrain later packets.

The accepted implementation source state is
`b0a28b681fa7b4dcda6ee1b67ff80bcd303c3eac`.

## P0-STATE closeout

- `H-P0-REGISTER-001`, `H-G-A0-001`, and `H-P0-CONTROL-002` were consumed
  with preservation, authority, and implementation evidence.
- STYLE and checkout-local Bookwright contracts now agree on H1-H10 and D05:
  the preface and Part I have no visible code, hidden plumbing is exempt from
  the visible 12-line ceiling, and assessed code production is forbidden.
- Exactly 20 invalid ledger enums were migrated; all 19 chapter stages remain
  `draft`, and all four mutable shared JSON files validate against their Draft
  2020-12 schemas.
- Installed-cache structure lint now resolves the live checkout rules from the
  repository root and a nested working directory. Bookwright cachebuster
  `0.2.0+codex.20260803091452` is installed, enabled, and discoverable in a
  fresh Codex process.
- All 371 child IDs, 188 packet IDs, aliases, expansions, 18 manifests, D05,
  and the independent `P1C-INTEGRITY` boundary were preserved.
- `H-P0-STATE-001` records the only consequential downstream discovery: the
  `WA-C00` preface packet must reconcile its visible-code promise with D05.

The accepted implementation source state is
`sha256:9eaca86d36b3b7593b831d820cfd881bbdb9c114837b9431e4cc9536562fc4ab`.

## P0-OUTSIDE closeout

- `H-P0-REGISTER-002`, `H-G-A0-001`, and `H-P0-CONTROL-003` were consumed
  with inventory, authority, routing, and exact-link evidence.
- The register now contains 82 independently closable canonical asks across
  16 kinds: decisions and policy, package selection and rights, recruitment,
  specialist sign-off, proof and release ownership, and exact external-action
  authorisation.
- Every ask names its owner, available evidence, recommended default, exact
  reply, blocked register items and gates, and resume condition. All 22 packet
  gates that directly depend on `P0-OUTSIDE`, every unresolved decision gate,
  all C00-C18 acceptance gates, and all exact external-action gates are covered.
- Every ask remains `drafted_unsent`; no external message was sent and no
  permission was inferred. Push, merge, tag, archive, and deployment remain
  unauthorised.
- The workflow validator now checks the ask schema, item/gate references,
  direct-dependent coverage, message state, and inventory totals. Its
  `invalid_outside_ask_link` negative fixture fails as required.
- P0-OUTSIDE found no future-relevant effect outside the canonical ask records,
  so it created no outgoing handoff; duplicating ask state in the handoff
  ledger would violate the packet contract.

The accepted implementation source state is
`state:sha256-aacc04b76559edbea0e656bdd4e2a027a5912eff82792fda557706a60a47bdf1`.

## G-A1a closeout

- The author and named statistical reviewer Luka Sikic jointly accepted the
  recommended D01 specification on 2026-08-03.
- Chapter 10 retains raw-label permutation only for an
  exchangeability/full-distribution null and uses `(b + 1) / (B + 1)` for
  finite random-permutation p-values. The approved specification also fixes
  the known-null demonstration, observational claim boundary, analytic
  widget/twin scope, and Bayesian balance.
- `OA-G-A1A-C10-SPEC` is `done`; no external message was sent and no broader
  authority was inferred.
- `H-G-A1A-001` carries the exact approved specification to `P1A-C10` at its
  `before_start` gate.
- No chapter prose or code was changed, and `P1A-C10` was not started.

The accepted decision source state is
`conversation:joint-G-A1a-approval-2026-08-03-Luka-Sikic`.

## P1A-C10 closeout

- `H-G-A1A-001` was acknowledged and consumed before the packet claim, and the
  accepted D01 specification remained the exact correction boundary.
- Chapter 10 now states the exchangeability/full-distribution null and its
  independent-unit, observational, and noncausal assumptions; retains the
  two-sided raw difference in means; and uses `(b + 1) / (B + 1)` for every
  finite random-permutation p-value.
- The known-null demonstration, Type-I/Type-II explanation, AI-error key, and
  bounded Bayesian contrast were corrected. The analytic normal-p-value widget
  and print twin remained unchanged and outside the permutation correction.
- Clean-session reproduction, an independent methods reread on the exact
  source state, checkout-local deterministic and manual style passes,
  structure and figure-introduction checks, the targeted HTML render, and
  source-diff checks all passed.
- No new forward-relevant effect was found. Chapter 11 follow-through is
  already represented by `R01-C11-inherited-permutation` and the dependency of
  `P1A-C11` on this packet, so no duplicate outgoing handoff was created.

The accepted chapter source state is
`chapter:sha1-a90549950c4f410f757bdec9b6ac680380ab7662`; the durable evidence is
`notes/reports/p1a-c10-methods-review-2026-08-03.md`.

## Findings that constrain later packets

- `P1C-INTEGRITY` is an independent packet for blocking token, manuscript,
  citation, concept, figure, and data checks; it is not part of PDF repair.
- All 18 displayed chapter reading times must ultimately be measured against a
  relevant source state, visibly labelled as estimates, or removed.
- Chapter 17's live spine must settle whether Chapter 13 is a prerequisite
  before either advertised route is published.
- Identity-pillar prose waits for its governed evidence package and approved
  brief; Chapter 17 retains the fairness widget and uses text analysis as its
  worked example.
- Any material chapter edit invalidates an older six-critic panel for final
  acceptance purposes.

## Simple implementation order

1. Control plane and baseline.
2. Correctness, licensing, and build safeguards.
3. Claim map, lifecycle, spines, terminology, and assessment policy.
4. Data catalogue, governed datasets, and reader pilots.
5. Chapter waves: `00-03 -> 04-06 -> 07-12 -> 13-17 -> 18`.
6. Solutions, appendices, and student pathways.
7. Whole-book continuity and editorial checks.
8. Release-candidate validation.
9. Publication only after separate authorisation.

## Exact next-thread prompt

Paste this into a new thread:

```text
Continue the ratified comprehensive-review implementation from the repository's
canonical state. Read AGENTS.md and fully read:
- notes/reports/comprehensive-review-implementation-plan-2026-08-03.md
- notes/reports/comprehensive-review-implementation-register.yml
- notes/reports/comprehensive-review-dashboard.md
- notes/reports/comprehensive-review-forward-handoffs.yml
Also fully read the checkout-local book-conductor instructions and its bounded
outside-ask reference. Do not rely on prior chat or the installed plugin cache
for mutable state.

Execute only the dashboard's next_permitted_packet, P1A-C11. Fully read
chapters/10-logika-testiranja.qmd, chapters/11-velicina-ucinka-i-snaga.qmd,
STYLE.md, ENRICHMENT.md, notes/struktura-knjige.md, the relevant comprehensive
review evidence, the P1A-C10 evidence report, and the checkout-local book-style
instructions. Do not rely on the installed plugin cache for mutable state.

Revalidate only R01-C11-inherited-permutation: remove or explicitly qualify
the Chapter 10 permutation assumptions inherited by Chapter 11. Ensure the
power demonstration names its null, statistic, independence, distribution,
and simulation assumptions. Preserve the estimation-first chapter role and
change no unrelated chapter material.

Reproduce every affected result from a clean session, obtain the required
independent statistical-methods reading on the corrected source state, run the
book-style deterministic and manual pass, targeted render, and packet exit
checks. Update the register, handoff ledger, and dashboard together, create one
scoped local commit only if every gate passes, and stop before G-A1b or any
later packet.
```
