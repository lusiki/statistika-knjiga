# Comprehensive-review implementation dashboard

This is a view of the canonical implementation register and forward-handoff
ledger, not a second task list. If this page disagrees with either YAML file,
stop and repair the control state before editing book content.

## Current state

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Gate A0 | Accepted: D01-D16 and O01-O03 |
| Branch | `revision/comprehensive-review` |
| Baseline | `c163bda524b7081ec6a41d5ab75370f1700b1748` |
| Control implementation | `b3463c7b6f7dc7e03a76f74f3a297e2e158e4c6e` |
| Active write packet | None |
| Last completed packet | `P0-OUTSIDE` |
| Next permitted packet | `G-A1a` only |
| Review parents | 36 ratified; 0 accepted |
| Atomic child inventory | Complete: 371 stable children; 4 accepted, 5 deferred with reason, 362 ratified; zero unmapped |
| Exact packet catalogue | 188 packets: 6 accepted and 182 ratified, with stable IDs, typed contracts, unique sequence, and just-in-time dependencies |
| Review source coverage | 18 exact section manifests; their fingerprint union equals all 371 children; zero uncovered actionable findings |
| Chapter stages | 19 `draft` |
| Open outside asks | 82 canonical asks, all `drafted_unsent`; 0 external messages sent |
| Invalidated or reopened work | None |
| Failed gates | None; P0-OUTSIDE passed ask-schema, exact-link, coverage, negative-fixture, authority, and scope checks |

No chapter prose was changed by `P0-OUTSIDE`.

## P0-REGISTER closeout

- `H-G-A0-001` and `H-P0-CONTROL-001` were consumed with evidence.
- The register contains 371 stable children under R01-R36, 188 exact packets,
  29 typed packet contracts, and 18 bidirectional source manifests.
- The validator reconciles every source fingerprint and requires structured
  receipts for every terminal packet requirement, output, and exit test.
- The `generic_packet_evidence` negative fixture proves that an arbitrary
  `done` token cannot close a packet.
- Eight forward handoffs, `H-P0-REGISTER-001` through `008`, preserve findings
  that constrain later packets.

The accepted implementation source state is
`b0a28b681fa7b4dcda6ee1b67ff80bcd303c3eac`.

## P0-STATE closeout

- `H-P0-REGISTER-001`, `H-G-A0-001`, and `H-P0-CONTROL-002` were consumed
  with preservation, authority, and implementation evidence.
- STYLE and checkout-local Bookwright contracts now agree on H1-H10 and D05:
  the preface and Part I have no visible code, hidden plumbing is exempt from
  the visible 12-line ceiling, and assessed code production is forbidden.
- Exactly 20 invalid ledger enums were migrated; all 19 chapter stages remain
  `draft`, and all four mutable shared JSON files validate against their Draft
  2020-12 schemas.
- Installed-cache structure lint now resolves the live checkout rules from the
  repository root and a nested working directory. Bookwright cachebuster
  `0.2.0+codex.20260803091452` is installed, enabled, and discoverable in a
  fresh Codex process.
- All 371 child IDs, 188 packet IDs, aliases, expansions, 18 manifests, D05,
  and the independent `P1C-INTEGRITY` boundary were preserved.
- `H-P0-STATE-001` records the only consequential downstream discovery: the
  `WA-C00` preface packet must reconcile its visible-code promise with D05.

The accepted implementation source state is
`sha256:9eaca86d36b3b7593b831d820cfd881bbdb9c114837b9431e4cc9536562fc4ab`.

## P0-OUTSIDE closeout

- `H-P0-REGISTER-002`, `H-G-A0-001`, and `H-P0-CONTROL-003` were consumed
  with inventory, authority, routing, and exact-link evidence.
- The register now contains 82 independently closable canonical asks across
  16 kinds: decisions and policy, package selection and rights, recruitment,
  specialist sign-off, proof and release ownership, and exact external-action
  authorisation.
- Every ask names its owner, available evidence, recommended default, exact
  reply, blocked register items and gates, and resume condition. All 22 packet
  gates that directly depend on `P0-OUTSIDE`, every unresolved decision gate,
  all C00-C18 acceptance gates, and all exact external-action gates are covered.
- Every ask remains `drafted_unsent`; no external message was sent and no
  permission was inferred. Push, merge, tag, archive, and deployment remain
  unauthorised.
- The workflow validator now checks the ask schema, item/gate references,
  direct-dependent coverage, message state, and inventory totals. Its
  `invalid_outside_ask_link` negative fixture fails as required.
- P0-OUTSIDE found no future-relevant effect outside the canonical ask records,
  so it created no outgoing handoff; duplicating ask state in the handoff
  ledger would violate the packet contract.

The accepted implementation source state is
`state:sha256-aacc04b76559edbea0e656bdd4e2a027a5912eff82792fda557706a60a47bdf1`.

## Findings that constrain later packets

- `P1C-INTEGRITY` is an independent packet for blocking token, manuscript,
  citation, concept, figure, and data checks; it is not part of PDF repair.
- All 18 displayed chapter reading times must ultimately be measured against a
  relevant source state, visibly labelled as estimates, or removed.
- Chapter 17's live spine must settle whether Chapter 13 is a prerequisite
  before either advertised route is published.
- Identity-pillar prose waits for its governed evidence package and approved
  brief; Chapter 17 retains the fairness widget and uses text analysis as its
  worked example.
- Any material chapter edit invalidates an older six-critic panel for final
  acceptance purposes.

## Simple implementation order

1. Control plane and baseline.
2. Correctness, licensing, and build safeguards.
3. Claim map, lifecycle, spines, terminology, and assessment policy.
4. Data catalogue, governed datasets, and reader pilots.
5. Chapter waves: `00-03 -> 04-06 -> 07-12 -> 13-17 -> 18`.
6. Solutions, appendices, and student pathways.
7. Whole-book continuity and editorial checks.
8. Release-candidate validation.
9. Publication only after separate authorisation.

## Exact next-thread prompt

Paste this into a new thread:

```text
Continue the ratified comprehensive-review implementation from the repository's
canonical state. Read AGENTS.md and fully read:
- notes/reports/comprehensive-review-implementation-plan-2026-08-03.md
- notes/reports/comprehensive-review-implementation-register.yml
- notes/reports/comprehensive-review-dashboard.md
- notes/reports/comprehensive-review-forward-handoffs.yml
Also fully read the checkout-local book-conductor instructions and its bounded
outside-ask reference. Do not rely on prior chat or the installed plugin cache
for mutable state.

Execute only the dashboard's next_permitted_packet, G-A1a. Prepare G-A1a only.
Show the Chapter 10 correction evidence, recommended D01 specification,
credible alternatives, exact blocked items and dependencies, and the exact
joint author/statistical-reviewer reply needed. Use
OA-G-A1A-C10-SPEC as the canonical drafted-unsent ask.

Do not edit chapter prose or control state, do not send an external message,
do not infer approval, and do not start P1A-C10 or any later packet. Return the
bounded decision packet and wait for the explicit reply.
```
